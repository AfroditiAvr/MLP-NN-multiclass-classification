# MLP-NN-multiclass-classification
This project was developed as part of the Neural Networks course at the Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It evolves multiclass classification of cifar-10 dataset using neural networks, as well as traditional classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Nearest Class Centroid (NCC). It concludes with a comparison between them.
